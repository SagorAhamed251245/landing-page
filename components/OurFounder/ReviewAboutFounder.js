        "It was my honor to work with Shiblu at Quicken Loans. He is one of the hardest working people I know. Heâ€™s a great thinker- always looking for new ways to do things better while learning and sharing with others. As technologist, he is second to none, as a co worker and team mate, he can always be counted on to contribute and lead in any way he can. I highly recommend him.",

        "I worked on several projects with Shiblu and they were great experiences. He is excellent in getting people to buy into what needs to be done on a project and to keep it moving forward. He also took the time to ensure any roadblocks to moving forward were resolves as quickly as possible. He is someone I would definitely want to work with again.",
