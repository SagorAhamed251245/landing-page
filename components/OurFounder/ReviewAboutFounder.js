Having worked with Shiblu on several team projects, I can attest first hand to his infectious ability to inspire those around him and put others needs before his own.

        "It was my honor to work with Shiblu at Quicken Loans. He is one of the hardest working people I know. Heâ€™s a great thinker- always looking for new ways to do things better while learning and sharing with others. As technologist, he is second to none, as a co worker and team mate, he can always be counted on to contribute and lead in any way he can. I highly recommend him.",

        "I worked on several projects with Shiblu and they were great experiences. He is excellent in getting people to buy into what needs to be done on a project and to keep it moving forward. He also took the time to ensure any roadblocks to moving forward were resolves as quickly as possible. He is someone I would definitely want to work with again.",
